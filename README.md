# Abstract

The work aimed to study the use of hierarchy in swarm systems. Swarm systems are multi-agent
systems that are characterized by three key aspects, which are dynamism, differentiation and
decentralization. A dynamic system reacts and adapts to environmental changes. Differentiation
is when many different agents work together. With decentralization, the loss of individuals does
not threaten the stability of the entire system. It has been studied when and how hierarchy affects
a multi-agent system, depending on the environment in which the system is placed and the type of
system control.
The work included simulations based on testing a population of solutions, where each solution
is a single multi-agent system with given parameters. The genetic algorithm was then run for a set
number of generations for a given environment. Three environments were analyzed, where each
successive environment was more challenging for agents to survive. Different versions of agent control
methods were also examined. Random method and different neural network structures. For each
combination of environments and control methods, simulations were performed with and without the
use of hierarchy in a given simulation.
Based on the research, it can be concluded that the use of a hierarchy has a positive effect on
a multi-agent system when placed in a challenging environment. On average, systems with a split
group scored higher than solutions with a uniform group. The increased complexity of the agent brain
led to higher overall performance. The only situation where the impact of the mentioned effects was
least was in the case of a low-threat environment and the performance of all agents was comparable.
